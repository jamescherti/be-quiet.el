The `be-quiet` Emacs package helps manage and minimize unwanted output in your Emacs environment. It is useful in contexts where controlling or suppressing verbosity is required.

## Installation

### Emacs: Install with straight (Emacs version < 30)

To install *be-quiet* with `straight.el`:

1. It if hasn't already been done, [add the straight.el bootstrap code](https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el?tab=readme-ov-file#getting-started) to your init file.
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package be-quiet
  :ensure t
  :straight (be-quiet
             :type git
             :host github
             :repo "jamescherti/be-quiet.el"))
```

### Emacs: Installing with use-package and :vc (Built-in feature in Emacs version >= 30)

To install *be-quiet* with `use-package` and `:vc` (Emacs >= 30):

``` emacs-lisp
(use-package be-quiet
  :ensure t
  :vc (:url "https://github.com/jamescherti/be-quiet.el"
       :rev :newest))
```

### Doom Emacs

Here is how to install *be-quiet* on Doom Emacs:

1. Add to the `~/.doom.d/packages.el` file:
```elisp
(package! be-quiet
  :recipe
  (:host github :repo "jamescherti/be-quiet.el"))
```

2. Add to `~/.doom.d/config.el`:
```elisp
(after! be-quiet
  ;; TODO: Add setq options here
  )
```

3. Run the `doom sync` command:
```
doom sync
```

## Usage

### The be-quiet macro

The simplest way to use the `be-quiet` macro is as follows:
```elisp
(be-quiet
  (message "You will not see this message")
  (message "You will also not see this message"))
```

The `be-quiet` macro silences specific function calls while allowing you to capture their output. For example:
```elisp
(let (output) (be-quiet (message "Foo")
                        (setq output (be-quiet-current-output)))
  (message "This was the last message: %s" output))
```

In this example, the message "Foo" is silenced, but its output is captured and stored in the variable output.

### The be-quiet-advice-add function

To prevent certain functions from generating output, use the `be-quiet-advice-add` function.

For instance, to disable the message "Indentation setup for shell type bash" when `sh-set-shell` is called:
```elisp
(be-quiet-advice-add #'sh-set-shell)
```

In this example, calling the `sh-set-shell` function will execute as usual without displaying any messages.

Here is another example to prevent `recentf` from showing messages during saving and cleanup:
```elisp
(with-eval-after-load "recentf"
  (be-quiet-advice-add #'recentf-save-list)
  (be-quiet-advice-add #'recentf-cleanup))
```

## Frequently asked question

### Identifying Functions to Silence in Emacs

You can assign a regular expression to the variable `debug-on-message` by adding the following line early in your Emacs init files. This will cause Emacs to invoke the debugger when a matching message is displayed during Emacs startup:
```elisp
(setq debug-on-message "Regular expression")
```

### What is the difference between be-quiet and shut-up?

The *be-quiet* package offers the same core functionality as *shut-up*, but with several enhancements:

- Provides new functions: `be-quiet-advice-add` and `be-quiet-advice-remove`
- Ensures internal helper functions are properly marked as internal
- Fixes byte-compiler warnings and other issues and improves docstrings for clarity and completeness
